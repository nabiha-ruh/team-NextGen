## Bot description 
- CAMERA (DFrobot Huskylens AI camera)    
  Why we used it: The WRO Future Engineers challenge requires the car to recognize lanes, signs, and obstacles in real time. The camera provides continuous image data, which we process with computer vision algorithms to keep the car on track and make decisions.
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)   
  While the camera handles vision, sonar ensures the car can measure distance to walls or barriers, helping with safe navigation and parking accuracy.
- Microcontroller( ESP32)    
 It processes sensor data, runs control algorithms, and sends commands to motors and actuators. The ESP32 is small, lightweight, and powerful enough to handle real-time operations for a self-driving car.
- Servo motor  (SG90)     
 Controls the steering mechanism. Servos are ideal for steering because they can rotate to exact angles, allowing the car to follow curves smoothly and make controlled turns in the narrow lanes of the WRO track.
